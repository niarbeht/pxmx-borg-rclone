# vzdump-borg-rclone

This project is nowhere near production-ready.  While it *should* be able to function for basic use, no guarantees can be made at all.

**Do not** use this in a production environment without a tested disaster recovery plan in place.  If you intend to make this a part of a backup and disaster-recovery process, make sure to test it thoroughly.  Documentation for recommended practices for what will be required to integrate this into backup/disaster recovery will be added after the code is further along.
